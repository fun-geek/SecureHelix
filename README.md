# SecureHelix
It's a DNA LOCK project with biometric authentication . Where it would ask for a fingerprint and also a DNA sequence to verify both the biometric and the sequence. If both of them match then the user can unlock the system . Also we are working on this project to make this as a real world security system and updating the databases to work finely.
