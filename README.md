# SecureHelix
It's a DNA LOCK project with biometric authentication . Where it would ask for a fingerprint and also a DNA sequence to verify both the biometric and the sequence. If both of them match then the user can unlock the system . Also we are working on this project to make this as a real world security system and updating the databases to work finely.

## Demo 
A simple front-end demo of a simulated **biometric + DNA sequence lock system**.  
This project showcases how modern authentication concepts can be represented in a lightweight **HTML/CSS/JS** application.

## âœ¨ Features
- Biometric scan simulation with animated scanner area.
- DNA sequence validation (only **A/T/G/C**, expected sequence hardcoded).
- Lock/Unlock system status updates in real time.
- Clean UI built with **vanilla CSS**.
